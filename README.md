# Hamla Game AI: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview

This project implements the Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms to power the AI for the Hamla game. Built using TypeScript, React, and Vite, this application offers a robust environment for playing Hamla, a strategic board game, against a challenging AI opponent.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the classic game theory Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move for the AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances the Minimax algorithm by incorporating Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, thus optimizing performance.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilizes React for a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing players to interact smoothly with the game.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses modern front-end technologies to reflect game changes in real time without reloading the page.
